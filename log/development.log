Sure, he tells me, \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E took some liberties by having a wormhole materialize near Saturn, but he, like Tyson, still enjoyed the film, and appreciated that it made these complex theories accessible to the 99% of the population who don\\u0026#8217;t study quantum field theory.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EHis appreciation for the science of \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E makes it hard for me to understand why others have condemned the film\\u0026#8217;s science as if it sullied their family honor. What are they so afraid of? That \\u003Cem\\u003EInterstellar\\u003C/em\\u003E\\u0026#8216;s pseudoscience will fraudulently inspire young men and women to become astrophysicists?

He took us up to the observatory in the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy (made possible by a donation from a certain wealthy Hopkins alum) and my classmates and I took turns looking at Saturn and other celestial objects through an enormous telescope. It was a moving experience—there I was, looking at a ball of gas hundreds of millions of miles away, in tremendous detail. Not a picture, not an illustration, but the actual planet itself.

It was very obvious that a lot of thought had gone into the science, especially General Relativity. It was clear that the writers used what we know about the physics of the Universe as boundaries (or at least speed bumps) for where and how the plot could evolve. The movie definitely offers teachable moments which I plan to use next year in class.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003C/blockquote\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EInteresting.

We emailed Uber for comment and will update this piece if we get any. \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003E\\u003Cem\\u003ETony is 49 years old. He is an UberSUV driver in New York City. Raised in Brooklyn, Tony has been working as a driver since 1986—first at a private-luxury car company and now at Uber. Edited excerpts of what he told Quartz: \\u003C/em\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIn 2012, I lost my car to Hurricane Sandy, and I had to rent out a car to drive around. Then somebody told me that a company called Uber was giving $1,000 to start driving for them, and then a certain percent for each ride. It was 25% for a sedan, and 28% for an SUV. So I went and started working for Uber.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBasically, there’s no \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.driveubernyc.com/tlc-process\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ehiring process\\u003C/a\\u003E or anything like that. You just go there, and they give you a class in which they tell you something about Uber, and basic stuff about what to do with the customer, how long to wait, and everything I at least knew as a driver because I went there with experience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThere is \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/10/08/uber-skimps-on-driver-training-then-charges-drivers-65-for-basic-driver-skills-course/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eno training\\u003C/a\\u003E. They basically hire people from the gutter. They don’t care. They just need bodies. They need somebody who can get their own cars, fit the best possible GPS, and start driving.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUber doesn’t have physical contracts. Everything is electronically done. But if you don’t sign on their terms and conditions, you cannot work. So we have to sign, though it’s actually not signing. They send a link, and you have to electronically enter and accept the terms. And these terms, even Uber guys who wrote them wouldn’t understand. That’s how long and complicated they are.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EBut it is like a little school. It has \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2014/08/14/what-are-we-actually-rating-when-we-rate-other-people/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Ea rating system\\u003C/a\\u003E. Though we are not supposed to be rated, Uber is supposed to be rated, the reality is different. After every ride, customers can give up to five stars for their experience.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EEarlier as a driver, I could see the rating a customer gave me. For a few months now, Uber has scrapped the option, so I don\\u0026#8217;t know what I am being rated.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ESo, mentally, these rating systems affect us a lot. When you’re doing a good job as a reporter, you don’t want people telling you that you’re doing a bad job. If I am driving somebody who doesn’t live in New York, and they complain that I took the wrong route, how would they know the route that I should have taken? New York doesn’t have too many exits. In my 20 years of working with corporate employees, I haven\\u0026#8217;t had a single customer complaining that I took the wrong route. We have to live in the fear of losing our jobs.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ECompared to my friends, I don’t have much problem because I am a VIP driver, and I have a 4.8 average. I can still get fired though, if I go below a 4.6.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ENow as the company has grown so fast, our customers are more like yellow-cab trash. I have kids jumping up and down. Businesswomen putting their feet up. I never had that before. In corporate, there were only business people, where everybody behaved themselves. In Uber, I pick up drunk people at night, and they throw up. I have people who behave themselves badly, and I can’t say anything because of the rating.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EYou have people in Uber—starting from the top manager to the guy who washes the floors—they have the same brains because when you go to talk to them, it’s like talking to a bunch of dummies. I wonder which limousine university did they go to—because there is none.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EMy friend who is a driver, he is afraid of his own shadow. He would never back-talk to a customer. But he got an email from Uber that there are a lot of complaints against him, though he doesn’t remember having even one. They called him to their office and charged him a $99 fee. Uber said the money was for advertising and commercials, but everyone knew it was to save their jobs. And they did that to many of my friends. This is how sinister they are.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EAnd if you ask them, the staff doesn\\u0026#8217;t know how to answer your question because they are told from the top that the computer tells us this. Well, what did you get hired for? To make your own decisions or you want the computer to make it? The computer doesn’t know customer relations. The computer doesn\\u0026#8217;t know the routes. The computer only gives you statistics.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey say bad ratings don\\u0026#8217;t affect the drivers getting fares, but it does. Computers are programmed by people. If they say \\u0026#8220;we have a problem from this guy, but he is still a good driver, let’s give him less work and tell the computers to give them only, say, five pick-ups a day.\\u0026#8221; It is very calculated.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOn Dec. 1, they are going to automatically put those below 4.6 in UberX—whether they like it or not. [Uber X is the lower cost Uber service where the base fare is $3 as compared with UberSUV, which is a luxury service with a base fare of $14; the per-minute cost in UberX is half as much as in UberSUV.] Some of my friends will have a problem because they are 4.6. One of them owns a very expensive vehicle, and his rating system is actually 4.2. He is afraid they will transfer him to UberX.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EUber is afraid, in my opinion, that if they lose to \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.amny.com/transit/tlc-proposes-rules-changes-to-hiring-drivers-1.9512638\\\"\\u003Ethe TLC (New York City\\u0026#8217;s Taxi and Limousine Commission) in court\\u003C/a\\u003E, they are going to lose customers. The rule says a driver cannot work for more than one base at once. And drivers in Uber are right now working for two or three bases, though TLC is catching them and giving them $500 tickets.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhat Uber did in the summers was give out iPhones to drivers, just like you give candies to kids, and also gave $500 to whoever joined. So, anybody with that phone and the app installed in the phone could work for Uber. They completely violated the TLC rule. They wanted all the business—they are like those pigs who want to eat everything.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey hired too many drivers, so now there is more supply than the demand.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIf you go to any Uber office, it is like a zoo—people come from different countries, because they heard about Uber. “Oh, we can work in Uber in New York.” But they have never driven cars here. I have a friend who came from Pakistan a few months ago, got a TLC license, and now works for Uber. And he has no knowledge of the city; all he does is follow the GPS route. And it’s not just this one guy; there are many others.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThese drivers come with no experience. Of course, customers are going to give bad ratings.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EI am working exclusively for Uber. But they are diverting more customers to UberX—and that takes away my fare. They told me, “Go get a good vehicle.” And I have one. I now own a Lincoln Navigator.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EThey promised me heaven, but I haven’t gotten that. It’s only hell for now. I am actually waiting for the TLC rule. If it does happen that drivers cannot work for more than one base, Uber will go after the drivers and get their phones back. Then they are going to lose UberX drivers—and we are going to start doing okay.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EWhen I started working with Uber, I was never free for more than five minutes. I was busy all day long. Sometimes, I just wanted to park my car and sleep. Now, I have too much time and I make less money. Well, the company has a lot of people who have downloaded the Uber app, but that doesn’t mean all of them are regularly booking cabs. So downloading the app is half reality of the statistic. I think a lot of people just try Uber once, and once they end up paying a lot of money, they don’t want to try Uber again.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOnly the payment is no problem. Every Thursday, you get your check. Only once they had a problem—and we all chimed in on the internet, and we gave them our piece of mind, so they fixed the system. That’s the only good thing, because I don’t know if they want to violate labor laws since there are going to be a lot of labor laws to violate.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EToday, we got an email that they will give us a discount for health insurance, with a company called Stride Health.

Because I don’t know how long am I going to be working for them; anyone can get fired with the current rating system. Even me, as a VIP driver, I am worried. There should at least be a 10-year assurance, and if not, then at least two years. And once you’re doing good, they should forget about the rating system. If Uber were the ones to be rated, they would get the lowest rating.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\u003Cimg alt=\\\"\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" src=\\\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=qz.com\\u0026#038;blog=39587363\\u0026#038;post=299655\\u0026#038;subd=qzprod\\u0026#038;ref=\\u0026#038;feed=1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" /\\u003E\",\"comments\":\"http://qz.com/299655/why-your-uber-driver-hates-uber/#comments\",\"pubDate\":\"2014-11-20T06:00:45-08:00\",\"category\":\"Uncategorized\",\"guid\":\"http://qz.com/?p=299655\",\"dc_creator\":\"Shelly Walia\",\"media_content_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap284410821273-e1416470098606.jpg?w=640\",\"media_content_type\":\"html\",\"media_title\":\"Hello, Again\",\"media_thumbnail_url\":\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap284410821273-e1416470098606.jpg?w=640\"}"], ["link", "http://qz.com/299655/why-your-uber-driver-hates-uber/"], ["published_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:00:45 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Why your Uber driver hates Uber"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:25:27 UTC +00:00]]

If you're on the hunt for a job, it’s good to use every tool you have and to have some fun doing it. With a few minutes and an Arduino, you can have the ultimate Monster.com powered Gmail account, complete with flashing lights!\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''This how-to was written by Miker Bot, a Brooklyn-based tinkerer, builder, fixer and writer.''\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Materials === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Image:LED300_f.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; * A new Gmail account, dedicated to the job hunt\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; * An Arduino\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; * An LED (and a suitable resistor if required)\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === The Arduino === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; When you receive an email to your new business-centric email account, the Arduino will turn on an LED to alert you. When you see the light, it’s time to respond.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 1. If you're unfamiliar with Arduinos, take a moment to read the [http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage Getting Started] page at [http://arduino.cc/ arduino.cc]. Also, I find it’s always satisfying to run a Hello World type program ([http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkingLED like this one]) before getting started.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 2. We'll be using the code [http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PhysicalPixelcode here] on the Arduino. There’s nothing to change, and it should upload fine onto any model. Upload the code and put an LED between Pin 13 and Ground. On many Arduinos there is a built in resistor on pin 13. There may be no need for a resistor, but refer to the documentation from your model to make sure.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; When the Arduino receives an 'H', the LED will turn on, and when it receives an 'L', it will turn off. You can test this by going to the Arduino program, clicking tools, selecting 'Serial Monitor' and entering the commands H and L manually.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Image:AvG2f.jpg|630px|thumb|right|]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026amp;lt;br clear=\\u0026amp;quot;all\\u0026amp;quot; /\\u0026amp;gt;\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Python === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The short Python script will check if you have new email, and a send signals to the Arduino automatically, either turning the LED on or off. It will loop as long as you leave it running. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 1. First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you're running OS X, you most likely do. The quickest way to check is to run Terminal (on OS X) or a Command Prompt (on Windows) and type 'python' without quotes. [http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download Here] is some more info about that, as well as the installation files. If you do need to install it, restart your computer before continuing \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 2. Download and install the extension for Python: [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial pyserial 2.6]. This will let our code talk the Arduino over the USB connection. The simplest way to install it on OS X is to:\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; A) Unpack the archive onto your desktop\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; B) Open Terminal\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; C) Enter “cd /Users/YOUR-USERNAME/Desktop/pyserial-2.6” (without the “s)\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; D) Enter “python setup.py install” Should you have any warnings about permissions, try prefacing that with “sudo” \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; There is a nice article on how to install both Python and pserial in Windows 7 [http://pythonfun.wordpress.com/2012/04/04/installing-pyserial-on-windows-7-with-python3-2/here].\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 3. Snag the Python file we need from [ http://code.google.com/p/arduino-gmail-led/downloads/detail?name=V0.1.zip\\u0026amp;amp;can=2\\u0026amp;amp;q= here]. Courtesy of Paul Sobczak from the hackerspace [http://www.tcmaker.org/blog/ Twin Cities Maker]. There are some small changes we need to make to the script. Open it up in your favorite small editor. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The first thing we need to change is the line “s=serial.Serial('/dev/tty.usbserial-A6008dvx', 9600)”. Open your Arduino program and click Tools. There you'll see the name of the Serial Port. In my case it is '/dev/cu.usbmodemfa131'. Replace the existing line to reflect your setup, making sure to keep the single quotes.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Enter your username and password for your Gmail account in the line: “rc,resp=M.login('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD')”\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Save and run the script and you should be ready to see the LED light up when you get a new email and turn off after you've read it. Send yourself a test message to check it out! You can add this script to your start up items in OS X by going to System Preferences\\u0026amp;gt;Users and Groups\\u0026amp;gt;Login Items. Or, on Windows 7, by placing a shortcut to it in the Startup folder within the Start menu \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Image:AvGf.jpg|630px|thumb|right|]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026amp;lt;br clear=\\u0026amp;quot;all\\u0026amp;quot; /\\u0026amp;gt;\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === RSS Feeds and Monster.com === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; If you've ever used Monster, you'll know that there is an advanced search field where you can put in location, distance, and keywords. Monster will already send you daily updates on the results of a search. But if you want to get a little more competitive, you’ll want updates in real time. The solution for this is to generate an RSS feed that will be forwarded to Gmail. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 1. Use this tool: [ http://www.nealgrosskopf.com/extras/monster/ www.nealgrosskopf.com/extras/monster/] and enter any search criteria you'd like. When you click 'Submit' it will redirect you to the feed, ignore whatever your browser encourages you to do and copy the URL, ignoring anything before 'rss.'\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 2. Go to [ http://blogtrottr.com/ blogtrottr.com], enter that URL and your email address. This will forward anything from the RSS feed to your email. There are several other services that do this, but this one is free, real time, and stable.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Finished! === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; You'll now be getting real time updates of job openings in your area, with a sweet light to notify you of them. Happy hunting!\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026amp;lt;youtube\\u0026amp;gt;UlzGU6IveRQ\\u0026amp;lt;/youtube\\u0026amp;gt;\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Work]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:DIY]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Internet]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026amp;lt;br /\\u0026amp;gt; \\u0026amp;lt;em\\u0026amp;gt;This article was originally written by mikerbot.\\u0026amp;lt;/em\\u0026amp;gt;\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2977/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476321/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2977/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476321/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2977/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476321/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2977/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:Create_a_DIY_Light_for_Your_Desk_That_Will_Light_Up_With_Notifications_About_Job_Openings\",\"pubDate\":\"2012-10-03T16:24:17-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2977/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CCreate0Ia0IDIY0ILight0Ifor0IYour0IDesk0IThat0IWill0ILight0IUp0IWith0INotifications0IAbout0IJob0IOpenings/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"jmckeel\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2977/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CCreate0Ia0IDIY0ILight0Ifor0IYour0IDesk0IThat0IWill0ILight0IUp0IWith0INotifications0IAbout0IJob0IOpenings/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Wed, 03 Oct 2012 23:24:17 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Create a DIY Light for Your Desk That Will Light Up With Notifications About Job Openings"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

You get to sleep in whenever you want! No one will notice if you throw away all your high heels! But without the structure of your commute and a scheduled lunch break, you find your once-productive workday sagging around the edges. Do you find yourself doing laundry at 4 p.m. instead of having meetings? Watching Netflix at noon and catching up on projects at 3 a.m.? Unless you’re most productive at night, like a bat, don’t let yourself get into a 23-hour-a-day work schedule. Here are a few tips on incorporating some healthy work habits as a freelancer. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Eat your daily frog. === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The quote—and resultant disgusting mental image—comes from Mark Twain: “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” But Gina Trapani explained it best, for Fast Company. In the evening, as you prepare to quit your desk, write down your most important task on a piece of paper and leave it on your keyboard. This task should be the one that you’re dreading the most tomorrow, whether that’s a deadline that’s approaching too fast, or a phone call that you’re sure will go badly. The next morning—the first thing, before you’ve even checked your e-mail—finish this one terrible task. Caffeine will be racing through your system, your mind will be fresh, and you haven’t gotten bogged down in the endless cycle of responding to e-mail requests and checking Twitter. That sense of accomplishment will give you momentum, or at least a bit of reassurance—even if you don’t get anything else done, at least you ate your frog. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Analyze your efficiency. ===\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Because there’s no natural breaks in a freelancer’s day, no commute to delineate the difference between “work” and “home”, many freelancers find themselves slipping into what can feel like 80- or 100-hour work weeks. Happily—or perhaps unfortunately—you’re very rarely working nearly as hard as you think you are, even if large chunks of time are spent saving and resaving spreadsheets. Programs like RescueTime help you track and analyze which websites are sucking away your precious minutes. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Writers like Zadie Smith and Nick Hornby also credit websites like Freedom and SelfControl with blocking incoming mail and distracting websites entirely, giving them large chunks of time to work without distractions. Programs like AntiSocial will block only social media, preventing you from trying to find everyone’s high school pictures.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; While some may turn to technology to help them increase their productivity, you might find that ditching it entirely will have better results. A notebook and pen, or a typewriter—or in severe cases, like Jonathan Franzen’s, a blindfold and earmuffs—can keep your attention from wandering. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Schedule short breaks. === \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Everyone needs time to recharge. For most at-home and entrepreneurial workers, it might not be feasible to turn off your computer and your Blackberry at 5 p.m. every day. But your productivity, your peace of mind and your incipient carpal tunnel syndrome will benefit from turning everything off for at least an hour or two during dinner. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; “Work-life balance” has become something of a buzzword. But restoring balance to your life doesn’t have to be something as drastic as taking off for a month-long yoga vacation in Bali. It can be something as simple, and restorative, as taking the time to prepare and eat a healthy snack in the afternoon instead of eating chips in from of the computer, or choosing to take a walk instead of making another pot of coffee. If you can manage it, going out for a quick run or going to the gym is an ideal short break. And there’s evidence that working out makes you smarter, improves your memory, increases your brain size and makes you a more efficient worker. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; === Make procrastination productive.===\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; First off, don’t feel guilty about it. Everyone does it, even Steve Jobs. Let’s say you ate your frog by 10 a.m. and, feeling especially virtuous, set aside a block of time in the afternoon for accomplishing another difficult task. The only problem is that while you’re sitting at your desk, you can’t seem to get off Pinterest. You also happen to be killing it at Words With Friends. Is it really 3:30 already?\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The odds are that you have important tasks at the top of your to-do list, and other tasks—equally necessary, but less urgent—farther down. If going through your old receipts just seems a little too tedious at the moment, don’t kill time with unproductive time-wasters. Instead, turn your attention items farther down on your to-do lists. Knocking out smaller jobs, like cleaning out your crisper drawer, will give you valuable momentum in order to face the bigger tasks. At the very least, you won’t have as great a sense of guilt when it does come time for you to turn off your phone for an hour. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Work]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:DIY]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Internet]]\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b297c/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476320/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b297c/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476320/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b297c/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476320/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b297c/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:Incorporate_Healthy_Work_Habits_as_a_Freelancer\",\"pubDate\":\"2012-09-19T11:41:30-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b297c/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CIncorporate0IHealthy0IWork0IHabits0Ias0Ia0IFreelancer/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"jmckeel\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b297c/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CIncorporate0IHealthy0IWork0IHabits0Ias0Ia0IFreelancer/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Wed, 19 Sep 2012 18:41:30 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Incorporate Healthy Work Habits as a Freelancer"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

We’re narcissistic and have pathetically short attention spans. We simultaneously have no respect for authority, but constantly demand encouragement from our helicopter parents. We live in our childhood bedrooms well into our twenties. And we don’t ever want to wear a suit to work. Ever. A grim portrait, or an accurate one? As it turns out, millennials have a lot to offer as employees. We don’t need job training in “social media”, because we grew up using it. We’re educated and altruistic. In fact, some people have [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/van-jones/graduating-off-a-cliff-th_b_850311.htm called] us ”the largest, most diverse, most open-minded, most tech-savvy, most eco-conscious generation in American history.” Learn how to market your unique abilities to potential employers with a few tips. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ===Embrace structural flexibility.=== \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Maybe your parents’ notion of a “real job” is a nine-to-five, with a 30-minute lunch and coffee break at 3. But this model is quickly becoming as outdated as wearing a fedora on the train. Hewlett-Packard introduced the concept of flex-time way back in the sixties. Now, we have flex-lives. Money is money, even if it doesn’t come with a 401(k) or complete benefits package. Piece together part-time paying gigs—perhaps in sales or healthcare—with career-building entrepreneurial work. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; If you’re not already an award-winning journalist or novelist, creating your own career will mean relying on lots of contract work. Before you begin, it behooves you to check beforehand to see if your dream job is something that people are willing to pay for—while you might be a world-class unicyclist, the demand for that particular profession is slim. Also, becoming a freelancer will require developing your sense of discipline. For example: Don’t get into the habit of going more than two days without showering or changing out of your pajamas. Putting together your own home office can help you focus. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; It’s unfortunate, but building a solid client base can take years. Although it has become fashionable to debate whether people who do things for free undermine the paid professions, working for free is often one of the only ways to develop your reputation. The good news is that when you’re not beholden to a corporation, you don’t have to restrict your marketing hours to when you’re off the clock. As a full-time or part-time professional freelancer, you can be constantly selling yourself or your product. This means that you will have to learn how to…\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ===Multitask.=== \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Don’t a lot of older people like to whine about how we have half a dozen tabs and chat windows open at once? This ability to juggle multiple projects comes in useful as a contract worker. Being a contract worker isn’t like working for a corporation. A contract worker is CEO, accounting and human resources all at once. Running your own entrepreneurial organization will require picking up a half-dozen different skills—any one of which could be valuable to a future employer. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; For example, build your own personal website. A familiarity with HTML and other programming languages is very attractive to employers who would otherwise have to hire separate employees. If you learn how to do your own accounting, you can often pick up temporary work as a tax preparer in the spring. Developing new skills keeps your brain sharp and, most importantly, keeps yourself employable.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ===Promote your comfort with social media.=== \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Sure, the average age of a Twitter user might be [http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/181368/social-media-users-age-gender-impact-site-choice.html 35 years old], or older. But we’re willing to bet that the vast majority of older employers find the whole phenomenon baffling. Many large and small companies hire “social media managers” for the express purpose of doing something which comes automatically to most of us—posting and updating blogs, Tumblrs, Facebook profiles and Twitter feeds. If you can demonstrate proficiency in social media—for example, if you have over 10,000 followers on Twitter—do not hesitate to mention that fact in job interviews or queries.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Besides showing that you’re conversant with the basic communication tools of our time, demonstrating that you’re linked to an unusually large number of people means that you have an invaluable resource at your fingertips. “Crowdsourcing” has become a hot topic among employers, and what else is crowdsourcing besides being able to broadcast queries to a large and responsive audience? \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Moreover, social media is taking the place of more traditional job-seeking tools. It’s an unfortunate thing to learn that after all those hours spent polishing your resume in high school or college, your employer is far more likely to rely on your blog or Facebook profile to determine if you’d be an effective employee. Rather than fussing over the size of your margins, your job search will be far more effective if you spent that time updating your LinkedIn profile—the number one social site that is checked by employers. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Just remember that people can detect insincerity, even through the giant filter that is the Web. Focus on building relationships and creating great content, rather than self-promotion, and you’ll find that the job search goes a lot easier. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ===Learn. Constantly.=== \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Maybe most millennials don’t memorize facts. For example, few of us can recite the order of the presidents, or can remember off the top of our heads various molecular structures. But the difference is that more than any other generation, we know how to find reliable information, in this vast and sometimes specious resource known as “The Internet”. It will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever had a relative ask how to use “The Google” that we’ve accumulated a huge number of tips and tricks in order to search faster, and more effectively, for information online.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Just a few examples: using the “site:http://website.com [search query]” to search particular websites or domains; misspelling query terms or rewording queries; or using different search engines—all techniques that are second-nature to us, but not to older generations. Online research skills are a valuable component to many entry-level jobs. Don’t be afraid to mention your abilities in queries or interviews. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ===And finally, volunteer.=== \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; One of our strongest assets as a generation is how civically engaged we are. We volunteer. We donate to nonprofits on Facebook and via text, something which Obama, one of the more recent tech-savvy politicians, has learned to [http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/08/obama-now-taking-your-donations-via-text/ capitalize] on. We want to work for companies with mottos like Google’s “Don’t be evil”—we want to work for companies whose beliefs are put into practice. Maybe working on your soul won’t help you get hired right away. But it will definitely make you a better employee, and better person, in the long-term.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Work]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:DIY]]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; [[Category:Internet]]\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2980/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476319/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2980/kg/358-390/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476319/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2980/kg/358-390/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476319/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2d3b2980/kg/358-390/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:Tap_the_Productive_Genius_of_Techy_Millennials\",\"pubDate\":\"2012-09-05T11:12:28-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2980/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CTap0Ithe0IProductive0IGenius0Iof0ITechy0IMillennials/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"jmckeel\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2d3b2980/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CTap0Ithe0IProductive0IGenius0Iof0ITechy0IMillennials/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Wed, 05 Sep 2012 18:12:28 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Tap the Productive Genius of Techy Millennials"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

There is only one problem with this scenario, which is that you're not part of a highly organized and trained team of mathematics grad students at MIT. The good news is that there are some statistical methods that you, too, can bring to bear on your game. Just remember that if a casino boss pulls you aside, you didn't hear it from us.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''This article is part of '''a wiki anyone can edit.'''

Card games are one of the few games in the casino—unlike roulette or craps, for example—where you have information. Unlike dice, which have no memory, a deck of cards has a standard and well-known set of suites, and you can see which cards are being played. In statistical terms, the player has a mathematical expectation greater than zero. Most counting systems require you to keep track of how many face cards are on the table, and adjusting your bets accordingly. Mathematician Richard Epstein charts out the optimal [http://www.gamblingtheory.net/index.html zero-memory strategy], but this is more memorization than most people are capable of after a couple of free drinks. Also, be subtle—while not technically illegal, most casinos will politely eject you from the table if they see you writing down the number of aces that are face-up.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Play the long game==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The well-known [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion Kelly criterion], or Kelly strategy, has been cited by Thorp himself and used by investors like Warren Buffett. Basically, it states that rather than trying to win each bet, you should optimize to improve your winnings over the long haul. That requires setting a budget (or “bankroll”, in gambler's terms) and only placing a certain percentage of your bankroll on each bet. That percentage is determined by taking into account the amount you're comfortable losing, and your odds of winning (or “edge”). If you set rules like this for yourself, you will avoid the chance that you will lose your mind and put the deed to your house on the table in the middle of a hot streak. It also prevents you from staking your life savings on game in which you have no edge, wisely suggesting that you walk away.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Remember the gambler's ruin==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; There are two well-known phenomena that occur at the gambling tables. The first is known as the “gambler's ruin”, which is used to explain many different mathematical equations that have the same result—if you keep playing long enough, you will have no money, either because the house has an infinite number of resources and can afford to keep playing longer than you can, or because people have a tendency to not reduce the amount they bet when they are losing. The second is the “gambler's fallacy”, which states that when an event hasn't occurred, it becomes more and more overdue to occur. A winning result isn't like a late bus—just because you waited for it doesn't mean it's going to come. Just because the last six times you flipped a coin, you got heads, doesn't mean that the next flip is more and more likely to become tails. The odds are still the same—fifty-fifty.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Just walk away==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; If the amount that you've lost is starting to make your palms sweat, just walk away. Even Edward Thorp walked away from a table where he was losing, saying, “My gambling strategy today is streamlined: I don't play much more than half an hour in one spot or win or lose too much there. If I start to lose, I cut my bets. I'm probably being cheated and I don't have time to find out.”\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''Based on an original article by Adrienne So.''\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa0/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476316/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa0/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476316/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa0/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476316/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa0/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:Quit_While_You%27re_Ahead\",\"pubDate\":\"2011-05-11T22:31:49-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa0/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CQuit0IWhile0IYou0J27re0IAhead/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"howto_admin\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa0/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CQuit0IWhile0IYou0J27re0IAhead/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Thu, 12 May 2011 05:31:49 UTC +00:00], ["title", "Quit While You're Ahead"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

But now that GPS trackers are cheaper than TV sets, everyone from local police to car-rental companies are getting into the act. And with the Barack Obama administration urging the Supreme Court to allow warrantless GPS tracking, the number of vehicles trundling around with tracking devices attached might be getting a lot higher soon. Is your car one of them? We'll show you how to find out.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Passive Trackers==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The easiest trackers to, er, track down are older, cheaper passive trackers. These collect data but don't beam it back out, instead storing it on an internal drive that has to be retrieved. They also run on their own battery pack, and usually have relatively weak antennas. Add up these factors and you're most likely to find one in an easy-to-access place, like the undercarriage of your car, the wheel well, or inside one of the bumpers. They can't see through metal, so don't bother checking your truck or under the hood for these.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; How to find it? Just get under your car and look around. If you see a black box, give it a yank. If it comes free, it's probably not factory-installed. Even if you're not sure what a normal car underside looks like, a surveillance device is going to look out of place. While you're at it, check the car cushions and unzip your headrests; those are both fine places to hide a passive device.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Active Trackers==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; More-recent devices not only gather your GPS location data, they send it back out to someone who may be following your movements on the internet right now. Many of them can be spliced right into your car's electrical system. No batteries and no need for retrieval mean that your shadow can be extra-sneaky when hiding the device. The engine compartment is going to be too hot, and the trunk is basically a metal box, so you can still pretty much rule those out. Start by looking behind the console, and don't stop until you've looked pretty much everywhere else. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Alternately, you can pick up a [http://www.brickhousesecurity.com/gps-detector-frequency-finder.html GPS detector], a handy device that can detect active devices. Be careful, though: Many active devices only send out info intermittently, and only when the vehicle is moving. You're going to have to find a friend -- if you have any you can trust -- to wave the device around while you drive, looking for evidence of privacy-invading data transmission. And avoid crowded areas: Someone talking on a cellphone on a nearby sidewalk can give you a false positive.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Deep Cover==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Todd Morris, CEO of BrickHouse Security, says he sells a high-end device that can track your location even if it's \\u0026amp;quot;in a safe, in a van, in an underground parking garage.\\u0026amp;quot; These devices rely more on cell-tower triangulation than GPS signals, but they can still tell the Powers that Peep where you are with startling accuracy.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Can a GPS detector find those sorts of devices? If you're such a high-priority target that someone's placed a state-of-the-art tracker on your vehicle, can you afford to take the chance? There's almost no chance a cursory investigation is going to find one of these gadgets. Your only choice is to have the car stripped down completely by a mechanic -- preferably one you've got something on -- and reassembled. Then of course you'll have to do it again and again, because if they're not watching you now, they might be a week from now.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Or, as a last resort, you can switch to a bicycle to transport you to and from your private deeds.

His talking points were the best arguments for running a virtual office that I’ve heard. I mean, sure, saving money on rent, getting the best people you can without worrying about location of each employee, are all good, but at an office, people go to meetings, get distracted by coworkers, and you don’t get the 3-4 hour blocks of time needed to really concentrate and work.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; If you ask people where they get the most work done, or when, they will inevitably say at home, on their porch, late at night, or early morning. So if you’re managing a virtual office, you are the future. But how to efficiently run one?\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''This article is part of '''a wiki anyone can edit.''' If you have additional tips about how to locate and visualize stored location data, please log in and contribute.''\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Time Differences==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Issue the first: Clearly, time zones. Yes, it’s great that your employees have time to work, but no one is entirely autonomous. You need to check up on people, let them know what’s going on, and yes, dare I say it, meet with them. When there are many different time zones among employees, this gets troublesome to deal with.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; A good move is to first have your employees on your own time zone, that way you will know they can be available when you need them. If you have a virtual assistant or receptionist, you’re going to want them either on your hours, or on the daylight hours of the time zone you’re most likely to do business in.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; It's not outrageous to ask someone one or two hours off to stick to your schedule. Other members of your team, sales, programming, art, what have you, can work on their own hours as long as they’re available for an occasional meeting.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Managing==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Issue the second: staff management. Now everyone believes three things: They are above average drivers, they have a great sense of humor, and they work well independently. Everyone dreams of working from home, setting their own hours, and finally enjoying life. While anyone who has been laid off or has worked from home knows the daily struggle with inertia, procrastination, and time organization. Work, or do dishes? Work, or watch Buffy DVDs?\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Much of the office hierarchy has grown because many people are more productive with a boss over their shoulders than not - without the threat of the boss, they’d just goof around. When looking who to hire for your office, consider that some people -- reception, PAs, etc -- are officially pros at doing virtual work. Look for someone who already has his or her business going working online. For the more specific work (artists, programmers, layout, writers, what have you) you will want to look for people who are more independent than most, with the discipline to work without a constant reminder to stay out of Farmville.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; When it comes to staffing issues, communication is key, just like in a regular office. When setting up new hires, make sure they understand your standards: i.e., everyone has AIM open during work hours, is equipped for a Skype video call, checks in at 9 a.m. local time, something. From Day One, lay out what is expected from workers -- deadlines, meetings, milestones . If someone is not performing as expected, deal with it immediately. It’s easy to let something slip: from Internet problems to a sick kid, there are many issues that will disrupt a workday at home. Issues do come up, we all understand, but if there is an honest problem, identify it immediately then find a way to work through it. When you don’t have day to day connections with people, it’s easier to not catch flagging performance.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Software==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Issue the third: Tools: The magical tools that make a virtual office work include video chat (Skype is a favorite), GoTo Meeting is an excellent tool for looking at each others' computer screens as you run demonstrations, and of course you’ll need IM programs for communication. Although the budget may strain under it, consider the importance of face-to-face time at least once a year. This will make for a strong business relationship, and it’s invaluable for conducting reviews, raise negotiations, and promotions or internal job changes.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''Original article by Mur Laferty''\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa6/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476310/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa6/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476310/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa6/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476310/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa6/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:How_to_Run_a_Virtual_Office\",\"pubDate\":\"2011-04-28T22:44:29-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa6/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IRun0Ia0IVirtual0IOffice/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"loresjoberg\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa6/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IRun0Ia0IVirtual0IOffice/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Fri, 29 Apr 2011 05:44:29 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How to Run a Virtual Office"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

Take mental note of this as it'll come in handy later while you’re rehearsing.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Choose Your Weapon==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; At the heart of every good interactive meeting is reliable tech. Though most companies have a preferred vendor for web conference software, don't be afraid to explore some of the other options out there.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Ultimately, the goal is to choose a flexible and easy-to-use platform that can deftly handle all your multimedia components. Old school chat-style meeting rooms are a baseline must-have feature, but webcam support for face-to-face interaction is an even more compelling approach. Remember, web conferencing software is essentially the engine for all your interactivity--so find something that fits your needs.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Pro Tip: Try to choose a service that's compatible with a wide range of operating systems and/or devices. The shorter the technological hurdle, the more likely your colleagues are to attend.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Map It Out==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Armed with an outline and software, it’s time to start laying down the foundation of your interactivity. At this stage you’re focusing on mixing up the long stretches of ‘blah blah blah’ with a little visual razzle dazzle. Start by dumping all your digital assets into the meeting software’s timeline and getting a rough chronological flow going.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; From here, you’ll want to fill the middle spaces in the timeline with text slides that encapsulate your most vital talking points. The second most vital talking points should be inserted next in the timeline, and so on. By the end of this step, you should have a (slightly bloated) rough draft mapped out. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Pro Tip: You're trying to create an informative interactive experience--not a breakneck schizophrenic info-dump. Always leave room in the timeline for questions and discussion. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Trim==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; No one likes sitting through a pointless, meandering half-hour web meeting. The mission at this point is to trim some of the fat and get closer to the tight runtime and focus setup in Step 1. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; This step also serves as a great opportunity to up your meeting’s interactivity. Are you noticing lengthy stretches of text slides and dry material? Remember that a picture (or graph, or infographic) is worth a thousand words. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Also, if you’ve gone the video route, explaining a process on-camera (with props!) is often vastly more interesting (and faster!) than having your attendees read through drab text slides.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Practice Makes Perfect==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Running an interactive meeting takes more than booting software and pressing “Play.” You’ll need to endure numerous dry runs (and maybe even a test audience or two), before you’ll achieve the desired polish of an intriguing and engaging interactive meeting.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Our advice? Try to do individual dry runs that focus on specific aspects of the meeting. Dress rehearsals focused on timing, transitions, or even just getting the software to run seamlessly during conversation can be life savers. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''Original article by Terrence Russell''\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa8/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;a href=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476307/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa8/a2.htm\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img src=\\\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/165666476307/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa8/a2.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width=\\\"1\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" src=\\\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/165666476307/u/0/f/661496/c/35185/s/2dcbfaa8/a2t.img\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:How_to_Design_an_Interactive_Meeting\",\"pubDate\":\"2011-04-28T22:13:26-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa8/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IDesign0Ian0IInteractive0IMeeting/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"loresjoberg\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaa8/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IDesign0Ian0IInteractive0IMeeting/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Fri, 29 Apr 2011 05:13:26 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How to Design an Interactive Meeting"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

Sure, she's on the front lines of history — but more importantly, how is she going to upload all of those photos to Facebook? Government restrictions can make it difficult for your friends abroad to get through to you, but it's not impossible. Here's some tips on how to keep lines of communication open.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''This article is part of '''a wiki anyone can edit.''' If you have additional tips about how to locate and visualize stored location data, please log in and contribute.''\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==By Phone==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Cell phones are some of the most useful, and widespread, devices all over the globe. Unfortunately, they're particularly vulnerable to government interference. In Egypt, the government shut off cell phone networks in order to keep activists from organizing, and in other countries cell phone companies can be required to hand over information like: your location; incoming and outcoming calls, and all the contacts in your phone book. If you have the option, Skyping over a landline is a much more reliable and secure means of communication. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==By E-mail==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The mere act of getting on the Internet in a country with severe restrictions can be a hassle. Landlines with dial-up services are harder to shut down, and if your friend is pretty handy, a [http://werebuild.eu/wiki/Egypt/Ham_radio ham] radio would work as well. Your troubles don't end there, though. Once you get online, the government may have blocked sites like Gmail and Facebook. Downloads like Tor, [http://www.ultrareach.com/ UltraSurf] and Freegate allow people to access blocked sites, but for security reasons, they may deny certain users privileges. If you're really good friends with your overseas buddy, try setting up a VPN network let them access blocked sites through your American computer. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==By Social Media or Instant Messaging==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Of course, these tips are moot if your friend can't manage to access the internet at all. But some common sense rules still apply. If you think you're at risk of being monitored — and hence, shut down — it would behoove you to take some basic precautions. Don't use your real name on social networks and encrypt all your sites with HTTPS security protocol. Skype and GChat through HTTPS-secured websites, like Google, and stop using third-party applications to access your social media accounts. These are more vulnerable to hackers, as well as government attacks. If there's an option for off-the-record instant messaging, such as in GChat, use it. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==More Basics==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; At this point, most of us have been on the Internet so long that we forget some basics of online security: using “ILoveMom1986” as your universal password, for example, is a bad idea. But for people living in areas of conflict, this is a very necessary mini-refresher course. Change your passwords to randomly generated ones and keep track of them with a program like LastPass. Keep up to date with your anti-spyware and anti-virus programs. And for God's sake, don't use USB sticks or open up any attachments when you don't know the person who sent it. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Resources==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Just remember that if it's hard for you to get on the Internet, you're not the only one. Activist organizations have a vested interest in keeping intelligence alive on the ground, and they have plenty of resources (and a lot of smart people working with them).

Now, when Global Financial Crisis has worsened the situation, importance of accurately counted budget and well-considered spending of money is brought into the forefront. That’s why it’s highly essential to learn to save money. The following tips helped me to save money on a day to day basis. Believe me, it’s easier that you think, just try it:\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 1. '''Make Lists.''' Whenever and wherever you go shopping, make a list of the products you REALLY need. Otherwise, you risk ending up with a full cart of so-called impulse stuff and an empty wallet. After got trapped into a similar situation once, I started to make lists, and, surprise, I don’t need as much as I used to buy.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 2. '''Home Food Rules.''' When you spend all day at work you definitely don’t feel like cooking once you return home. I absolutely understand you but that’s the right way to success. Count how much you spend eating out and compare it with the cost of home food. Impressed, yeah? I cannot but mentioning lunch time at work. Why not to take a snack from home? Do it at least three times a week and you will see the difference. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 3. '''Make a Budget.''' Count your total income, then take a piece of paper and make a list of monthly costs (bills, mortgage payment, fuel cost, movie, café, etc) with supposing sum of money to spend. Your task this month is not to exceed the number in the budget list. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 4. '''Credit Card Is Evil.''' Well, I exaggerate, of course, but there is something in these words. Pay for everything in cash, which prevents you from overspending. If you cannot stop using the credit card at all, at least restrict its usage.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 5. '''No Fees. Be Responsible.''' What you need is to get organized. I personally set for myself a deadline that is five days earlier that an actual deadline. Several months and it turns into a money-saving habit. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 6. '''Set Goals.''' I think it’s useless to save money if you have no a definite goal. My husband once said: “I want to buy a car in 6 month”. And since then we knew what we were saving for. I would advise to set short-term goals, otherwise you may get disillusioned soon. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 7. '''Save On Fuel.''' Oh, that’s a sore point for most. The first step to success we made was to change a car for the one that consumes less fuel. Besides, we use only one car instead of two most time. At the weekend we used to drive to the countryside, now we spend free time walking or riding. That resulted even more effective that we thought at first.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 8. '''Stay Away From Lavish Friends.''' Yes, they are nice people, but their habits oppose to your money-saving purposes. They will never support you as their principle is “live your live today and don’t think about tomorrow”.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 9. '''Look Back and Make Conclusions.''' After a couple of months of your new life look back and make conclusions about your first results and success. All the tips are individual, and you don’t have to follow all of them. So, re-evaluate the tips according to your personal situation.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; 10. '''Work, Work and Work.''' Don’t you think that it’s possible to save earning little? Develop your professional skills, climb career ladder and earn more. Successful people attract money. \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; These tips are based on my personal experience and I will be really glad to know that they could help anybody else to learn to save money.

Did the applicant really intern at JPL after graduating manga cum laude from Harvard? If the resume is vague, check out the applicant on LinkedIn. Searching on Facebook or MySpace, however, is an ethical grey area, since those sites are supposed to be more personal than professional.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Another way to trim the fat is to pre-interview your candidates. [http://knol.google.com/k/use-google-docs-to-pre-interview-job-applicants Google Docs has a handy tool for this], but you can find others online. Also, be sure to have them e-mail you any portfolio materials or samples of their work ahead of time. The more you know before the interview, the better it will go.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Once you’ve discovered that yes, the applicant really does hold the patent on Silly Bandz, it’s time to arrange the digital interview. Next up is your most important decision: live or taped?\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; In a taped Internet Interview, a third-party company such as [http://www.hirevue.com/ HireVue] sends your applicant a pre-taped series of questions, the applicant has a set amount of time to answer, and you get the results. It’s straightforward, impersonal, and shows the applicant that you view them as little more than a potential cog in the machine that is your faceless corporation. Check out [http://www.forbes.com/2008/11/18/interview-internet-webcam-lead-cx_tw_1118bizbasics.html the Forbes article on taped interviews] for more.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; A live Internet Interview brings you the fun of a job interview without having to spring for coffee. It requires more equipment, both for the applicant and interviewer, than a taped interview, but the applicant can buy a webcam on Amazon for $25-$30, or you can send them to a public video conferencing room, which you can rent in most cities. Just search for “public video conferencing rooms” and the applicant's city to find a location.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Preparation==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; You only get one chance to make a first impression, so prepare seven to 10 questions in advance. These should range from the expected (What major challenges did you face in your last job, and how did you overcome them?), to the self-serving (Why do you want to work here?), to the tangential (What position would you play on the company softball team?).\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Now create your look. Think of this as a performance: You’re playing the part of the all-powerful employer dangling the keys to financial freedom. Dress professionally, preferably in a dark suit and red ‘power’ tie. Do not wear white, as it washes out on camera. Remember that you will only be seen from the waist up, and consider going pantsless if you like.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; You also need to set your stage. What backdrop best represents your company? Bookshelves filled with studious-looking tomes? Tables covered in intimidating lab equipment? A double sunset on Tatooine? Equally important is the right camera angle. Try setting the camera slightly below your line of sight, so you’re looking down on the applicant in judgment.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Once everything’s ready, schedule on-camera run-throughs with someone else playing the interviewee, then watch the playback to identify annoying habits such as random tongue thrusts that you’ll want to control during the actual interview.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==During the Interview==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; Show time! Start by turning on your computer and making the connection. If you need help, check out [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wror0ZFSsGU a YouTube video entitled “Have a Job Interview Online with VOIP.”]\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; During the interview, be professional and direct with your questions. Do not wander off into small talk, which can get you into trouble. If more than one person is going to interview the applicant, have them wait in the in the room with you, off-camera but ready to step in without delay when their turn arrives.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ==Post-Interview==\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; The most important thing you can do after the interview is decide whether or not to hire the applicant. You won’t be making that decision right away, but you should acknowledge the applicant with a thank-you e-mail and manage their expectations by including a realistic timetable of when they can expect to hear from you.\\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; \\u0026lt;br /\\u0026gt; ''Based on an original article by David Neilsen.''\\u0026lt;/div\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaad/mf.gif' border='0'/\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;br clear='all'/\\u0026gt;\",\"comments\":\"http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Talk:How_to_Interview_a_Job_Applicant_Over_the_Internet\",\"pubDate\":\"2011-04-26T15:27:20-07:00\",\"guid\":\"http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaad/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IInterview0Ia0IJob0IApplicant0IOver0Ithe0IInternet/story01.htm\",\"dc_creator\":\"loresjoberg\"}"], ["link", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661496/s/2dcbfaad/l/0Lhowto0Bwired0N0Cwiki0CHow0Ito0IInterview0Ia0IJob0IApplicant0IOver0Ithe0IInternet/story01.htm"], ["published_at", Tue, 26 Apr 2011 22:27:20 UTC +00:00], ["title", "How to Interview a Job Applicant Over the Internet"], ["updated_at", Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:35:08 UTC +00:00]]

The last attempt at comprehensive immigration reform failed in 2007; the most recent overhaul was accomplished in 1986.
